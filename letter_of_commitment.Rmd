The Fenland Study confirms that these data align with the needs of the
proposed analytical framework (causal inference, longitudinal
trajectories, mediation, clustering, and prediction models). No new
participant‑level data will be collected, and all work will comply with
existing ethical approvals.

2.  **Commitment to No‑Payment Access (Conditional on Funding)**\
    If the project is funded under Inter‑SUSTAIN Part 2, the Fenland
    Study commits to providing no‑payment access to the above‑listed
    data types, in accordance with its governance and data‑sharing
    policies. The study management confirms feasibility of data access
    within standard timelines.

3.  **Incompatibilities or Limitations**\
    The following limitations should be noted, none of which are
    expected to impede the proposed research:

    -   [Please add any limitations]

These limitations are standard for the cohort and do not affect the
ability to carry out the analyses proposed.

4.  **The project will generate following added value to the Fenland Study
    :**\

<!-- -->

a)  Reproducible Methods

-   Causal inference models including pathway‑specific mediation\
-   Machine‑learning‑based prediction models\

b)  Harmonisation workflows between Fenland, ADDITION‑PRO, and UK
    Biobank

-   All workflow code (including data processing, analysis, and
    validation) will be published on GitHub for sharing reproducible
    workflow.

c)  These outputs will enrich the utility of the Fenland data and
    contribute to future precision‑prevention research, including:

-   Derived metabolic trait clusters, providing improved
    characterisation of metabolic heterogeneity across individuals in the Fenland study.
-   Identification of causal genotypes, metabolites, and phenotypes that influence cardiometabolic disease risk.

**Status of Applicant and Collaborators as Users of the Database**\
The Principal Investigator (Daniel R. Witte) and collaborating Danish
partners are new users of the Fenland Study.

**Statement of Support:**\
The Fenland Study management confirms full support for this project and
its scientific, ethical, and practical feasibility.\
