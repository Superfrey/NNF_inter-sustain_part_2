People at high risk of type 2 diabetes are not currently being systematically identified, primarily because of variation in who progresses to diabetes. This project investigates the causal role of natural incretin and glucagon responses, aiming to identify the primary drivers of progression toward diabetes and diabetes related complications. The project will use the deep phenotyped data in the Fenland Study.

The Fenland Study is well suited as the selected database because it combines OGTT based incretin and glucagon measurements, genetics, proteomics, metabolomics, DEXA derived adiposity, liver function biomarkers, and long term cardiometabolic outcomes in a general population cohort. The study includes three phases of examination from 2005 to 2025, which allows for the assessment of individual trajectories in cardiometabolic risk. We will validate findings in the Danish ADDITION PRO study and the UK Biobank. The project is divided into three parts. First, using traditional and newer methods of causal inference, including genetically predicted and phenotypically measured traits, we aim to determine the causal relationship between incretin and glucagon responses and long term cardiometabolic outcomes and to identify mediating pathways such as liver health, inflammation and metabolite profiles. Second, we will investigate incretin and glucagon responses in conjunction with metabolic traits that contribute to heterogeneity in metabolic dysfunction risk, such as liver health and inflammation, and aim to decipher the impact of each metabolic trait on long term cardiometabolic risk. Third, we will identify and predict machine learning based metabolic clusters using clinical and omics data.

By combining new epidemiological methods and machine learning techniques to characterize individual risk of progression toward cardiometabolic disease, and by clarifying the causal role of natural incretin and glucagon release, including important mediating pathways, this proposal aims to help identify individuals who have the greatest potential benefit from early intensive intervention and to pinpoint targetable biomarkers.

Type 2 diabetes develops differently from person to person, and today we cannot easily identify who is most at risk. This project uses data from the large Fenland Study to understand how two natural gut hormones, incretin and glucagon, influence the body’s ability to control blood sugar. By combining hormone measurements with information on liver health, body fat, inflammation, genes and metabolism, we aim to discover why some people progress to diabetes or other cardiometabolic diseases while others do not. The project will also create simple tools that can help identify people who may benefit from early and targeted prevention.

## Purpose

This Inter-SUSTAIN Part 2 project aims to use the Fenland study to elucidate the role of natural incretin and glucagon responses as drivers of heterogeneity in the long-term risk of diabetes and related complications, and to map clinical and biological traits associated with these responses, with particular emphasis on liver health, adiposity, and inflammation. In doing so, we aim to identify patterns of metabolic dysfunction that may predict progression to type 2 diabetes and inform personalized treatment strategies.

The specific aims are to:

a)  Phenotypically and genotypically investigate the causal role of natural incretin and glucagon responses to an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) in determining the risk of regression to normoglycemia, progression to type 2 diabetes, and the development of diabetes-related complications. This will be conducted using data from the Fenland study and the Danish ADDITION-PRO cohort, linked to comprehensive outcomes from the Danish National Health Registries.

b)  Identify metabolites and biomarkers for liver health, adiposity and inflammation that mediate the association between phenotypically measured (Fenland study, ADDITION-PRO) and genetically predicted (Fenland study, ADDITION-PRO, UK Biobank) incretin and glucagon responses and cardiometabolic outcomes, with particular emphasis on direct and indirect markers of liver function.

c)  Map dimensions of metabolic traits in conjunction with incretin and glucagon responses to decipher their role in deteriorating glucose metabolism and their relationship to long-term cardiometabolic health.

d)  Predict clustered dimensions of metabolic traits using clinical markers, metabolites, and genes.

## State-of the art

Pre-diabetes is a complex state associated with increased risk of progression to type 2 diabetes and related complications[@wagner2021; @tabák2012; @birkenfeld2024]. However, not all people with pre-diabetes progress to diabetes; many persist in the prediabetic state or regress to normoglycemia over the course of various years[@tabák2012]. Remission to normoglycemia has been shown to reduce the risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality[@vazquezarreola], however, it remains unclear to which extend if the remission is driven by lifestyle changes or by a heterogeneous low-risk subgroup.

Recently the idea of metabolic heterogeneity in type 2 diabetes has been extended to pre-diabetes, and traits that distinguish individuals most likely to progress to diabetes, such as insulin-resistant fatty liver and visceral adiposity-related renal dysfunction, have been identified[@wagner2021]. In recent years, incretins (Glucagon Like Peptide 1 \[GLP 1\] and Gastric Inhibitory Polypeptide \[GIP\]) and the hormone glucagon have gained increasing attention as targets in therapeutics for prevention of type 2 diabetes and diabetes-related complications[@kahn2024; @jastreboffaniam.2025; @jastreboffaniam.2023; @sanyal2024; @lincoffa.michael2023]. GLP-1 and GIP enhance post-meal insulin secretion, supporting efficient nutrient handling[@nauck1986]. Glucagon serves as a counter-regulatory hormone to insulin and maintains glucose balance both during fasting and following glucose intake[@hædersdal2023]. However, in the context of heterogeneity in pre-diabetes, the role of natural incretin and glucagon responses for the progression to type 2 diabetes and diabetes-related complications remains unexplored. Prior research in the Danish ADDITION-PRO study showed that, individuals with pre-diabetes and type 2 diabetes exhibited up to 25% lower natural GLP-1 responses to oral glucose[@færch2015]. Additionally, impaired glucagon suppression and elevated fasting glucagon levels have been observed in individuals with insulin resistance and early glucose dysregulation [@færch2016], involving hepatic insulin resistance that impairs the turnover of branched-chain amino acids [@weweralbrechtsen2018]. However, these findings have been limited investigated in relation to prospective cardiometabolic outcomes[@jujic2020]. A limitation of the ADDITION-PRO cohort is the selection of individuals at high risk of diabetes based on diabetes-specific risk scores, which limits the generalizability of the findings to the broader populations.

## Background

The Fenland Study is a pioneering population-based cohort that has advanced precision in identifying individuals at high risk of type 2 diabetes [@carrasco-zanini2022] and elucidating causal pathways underlying cardiometabolic disease [@desilva2019; @wittemans2019; @lotta2021; @agrawal2024]. Leveraging extensive phenotypic and genetic data, Fenland has established causal relationships between liver function markers, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and type 2 diabetes [@desilva2019], as well as between DEXA-derived adiposity traits and metabolic dysfunction-associated liver disease [@agrawal2024]. Mechanistic links between interleukin-6–mediated inflammation and type 2 diabetes have also been uncovered [@bowker2020], highlighting the interplay between inflammatory and metabolic pathways. This precise characterization of adiposity, inflammation, hepatic health, and incretin–glucagon dynamics provides an unparalleled resource for investigating metabolic heterogeneity and its long-term impact on cardiometabolic health.

We hypothesize that dysregulated incretin secretion and inadequate glucagon suppression, together with insulin resistance, accelerate metabolic dysfunction by activating hepatic and inflammatory pathways in individuals at high risk of diabetes. This hypothesis will be tested through three work packages:

### Work Package 1: Investigate causal relationship of neutral release of incretin and glucagon and long-term cardiometabolic disease and identify mediating pathways.

Hypothesis for Work Package 1: Natural incretin and glucagon responses play a causal role as drivers of the risk of progression from pre-diabetes to type 2 diabetes and diabetes-related complications as well influence cardiometabolic trajectories. In this pathway, biomarker and metabolites related to liver health play a mediating role.

Natural incretin and glucagon reposes in epidemiological studies have been mostly investigated cross-sectionally, with a few exceptions[@jujic2020]. The Fenland study includes \~12,000 individuals at baseline who underwent measurement of natural incretin and glucagon responses during a 2-point (0, 120 min) oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) in 2005-2015, i.e. before the introduction of incretin based therapies. This unique timing provides an opportunity to prospectively analyze the associations between individuals's natural hormonal responses to glucose and progression to diabetes, regression from prediabetes to normoglycemia, and risk of diabetes-related complications. Preliminary findings from ADDITION PRO in a population with high risk of diabetes showed that per SD higher glucagon (incidence rate ratio IRR: 1.38 CI: 1.15 to 1.67) and GLP-1 responses (IRR: 1.34 CI: 1.05 to 1.71) at 120 minutes during the OGTT are associated with incident heart failure over an 11-year follow-up period.

Genetic variants, clinical biomarkers and metabolites serve as valuable indicators of individual predisposition for specific phenotypes and mediating pathways (metabolites and clinical biomarkers) that link phenotypes to disease outcomes. We want to use newly developed GLP-1, GIP, and glucagon PRS to strengthen causal inference by applying them as instrumental variables in Mendelian randomization studies[@daveysmith2014]. Identification of metabolic pathways that mediate the effect of genetically determined phenotypes on the incidence of diseases such as type 2 diabetes helps us understand the biological mechanisms that link traits to disease. This understanding in turn supports the development of new targeted interventions based on metabolic pathways.

### Work Package 2: Mapping metabolic dimensions and their interaction with incretin and glucagon responses

Hypothesis: Incretin and glucagon responses may exert protective or compensatory effects under conditions of obesity, hyperglycemia, insulin resistance, and beta-cell dysfunction, with liver health and inflammation as effect modifiers.

Obesity and insulin resistance are central drivers of type 2 diabetes. Recent clustering analyses highlight liver fat as a key determinant of heterogeneity among individuals with prediabetes regarding progression risk [@wagner2021]. Reduced liver function interacts with insulin resistance, glucose and glucagon responses, and is accompanied by low-grade inflammation and morphological changes, particularly MAFLD [@winther-sørensen2020; @stefan2025; @hædersdal2023; @weweralbrechtsen2018]. GLP-1 and GIP reduce hepatic inflammation [@hammoud2023], underscoring liver function as a central pathway modulating diabetes risk and interacting with incretin and glucagon responses. Fenland includes liver biomarkers (γ-glutamyl transferase, ALT) and DEXA scans for regional fat mass [@powell2020], complemented by metabolomics (acylcarnitines, amines, sphingolipids, phospholipids) and inflammatory markers (IL-6, adiponectin, CRP) [@gnatiucfriedrichs2023; @vogelzangs2020; @beyene2020].

Machine learning–based dimensionality reduction will identify clusters of metabolic traits, enriched with metabolite profiles and partitioned PRS for type 2 diabetes [@suzuki2024; @udler2019]. This approach will reveal phenotypes driven by genetic risk and metabolic traits contributing to cardiometabolic disease.
￼
### Work Package 3: Predicting incretin and glucagon responses and metabolic dimensions using clinical and biological traits

Hypothesis: Population heterogeneity in incretin and glucagon responses, together with metabolic dimensions identified in Work Package 2, can be predicted using clinical, genetic, and metabolic biomarkers, enabling stratification by risk of progression to type 2 diabetes and related complications.

Because full incretin and glucagon response assessment is impractical in clinical settings, WP3 aims to establish a practical biomarker set that accurately characterizes these responses. In addition, we will predict metabolic dimensions and clusters identified in Work Package 2. Analyses in the Fenland Study will be conducted across three levels: (1) traditional clinical characteristics,
(2) metabolomics profiles, and (3) genomic data.

The predictive utility of these traits will be evaluated in relation to cardiometabolic outcomes in large population-based cohorts that include the same biomarkers but lack incretin and glucagon measurements, such as the UK Biobank, and through available markers in Danish registries.

To extend findings and predicted characterizations in other cohorts, will use the Danish ADDITION-PRO Study[@johansen2012] and UK Biobank[@bycroft2018] and as validation cohorts.

### Causal inference analysis

To quantify the causal relationship between incretins, glucagon, and cardiometabolic disease, we will apply traditional time-to-event analysis methods (Poisson and Cox regression) within the Fenland Study, using adjustments informed by directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). We will also characterize trajectories of cardiometabolic profiles, including glucose, lipids, kidney function, adiposity markers from DEXA, liver markers, and inflammatory biomarkers, using linear mixed-effects models.

To strengthen causal inference and account for unmeasured confounding, we will conduct Mendelian randomization using pathway-specific polygenic risk scores (PRS) as instruments for incretins and glucagon [@daveysmith2014], leveraging data from the Fenland Study, ADDITION-PRO, and the UK Biobank [@mrcepidemiologyunit].

To identify mediating pathways and key metabolites linking incretin and glucagon responses to cardiometabolic disease, we will apply a structural causal algorithm (NetCoupler) [@johnston2020] to detect sequential causal pathways involving metabolites. Based on these findings, structured causal mediation analyses [@vanderweele2015] will quantify direct and indirect effects of candidate metabolites on cardiometabolic outcomes.

![**Figure 1: Structured causal analysis framework of incretin and glucagon responses and their association with the risk of progression to cardiometabolic disease**](figures/DDEA_Proposal.pdf){width="8in"}

### Machine learning analysis

**Multidimensional profiling: Dimension reduction and clustering**

Evaluating the risk associated with incretin and glucagon responses to a glucose load in isolation is limited without considering concurrent insulin, glucose regulation, and other metabolic traits. To address this, we will apply principal component analysis (PCA) and uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) to capture the strongest sources of variance in the combined OGTT response across all four hormones and glucose.

Building on this framework, we will leverage data from previous work in The Fenland Study and ADDITION-PRO, which include genotypes, metabolomic profiles, and markers of metabolism and inflammation [@mahendran2017; @buckley2017; @deichgræber2016; @johansen2012; @færch2015; @færch2016; @madsen2024]. By combining liver function biomarkers derived from imaging and blood measurements, we aim to generate a comprehensive, multidimensional indicator of liver health.

![Figure 2: Illustration of dimensionality reduction of metabolic traits into metabolic clusters](figures/fig2_pca.pdf){width="8in"}

PCA and UMAP will then be used to integrate these variables and identify key metabolic dimensions that reflect the interplay between incretin and glucagon responses alongside glucose–insulin dynamics during the OGTT [@zhou2024]. We will further incorporate dimensions related to obesity, insulin resistance, inflammation, and liver health markers, and examine their associations with diabetes risk [@healy2024]. Finally, metabolite-based profiles and partitioned polygenic risk scores (PRS) will be analyzed separately in relation to cardiometabolic outcomes and then integrated to enrich the multidimensional metabolic profiling.

**Prediction of metabolic clusters**

To predict incretin and glucagon responses based on clinical and metabolite data, we will apply a two-layered modeling approach in the Fenland study. Clinical and metabolic profiles will be used separately and in combination to predict responses. For variable selection in both layers, we will apply two strategies: restricting variance and using linear LASSO regression to shrink and select the most predictive variables. To support this, we will employ machine learning models to capture undefined interactions and identify important predictors based on variable importance[@dietrich2016]. Our approach follows established principles in machine learning and statistical modeling, adhering to standardized practices for prediction, reporting, and validation [@collins2024; @lopez-ayala2025; @collins2024a; @riley2024].

These PRSs will be incorporated into the aforementioned predictive layers as composite predictors of incretin and glucagon responses. PRS for other relevant traits such as obesity, insulin resistance, beta-cell function, liver function and low-grade inflammation will also be considered where relevant.

## Feasability and implementation

As part of the collaboration between the MRC Epidemiology Unit and Novo Nordisk Foundation Center for Basic Metabolic Research, a research group are currently developing PRS for GLP-1, GIP, and glucagon. 

### Collaboration [- Needs something more connrete and specific]

The synergy between this project and the MRC Epidemiology Unit lies in the integration of deep-phenotyped metabolic data with large-scale population health surveillance. The MRC Epidemiology Unit provides an environment for precision epidemiology. By combining the Unit’s global leadership in studying the genetic and environmental determinants of obesity and type 2 diabetes with the projects focus on natural incretin and glucagon responses, we create a powerful framework to move from observational data to causal understanding. This collaboration allows for the cross-pollination of Danish clinical depth and the UK’s extensive population-based datasets, ensuring that findings regarding metabolic drivers are both biologically robust and representative of the broader population.

The MRC Epidemiology Unit, through the mentorship of experts in the Fenland Study, including Professor Nicholas Wareham and Professor Simon Griffin, will serve as the primary international host and scientific advisor. Their role, together with their research teams, will encompass three key areas:

**1. Data Provision and Oversight:** Granting access to the Fenland Study (n = 12,435) and providing training to ensure a comprehensive understanding of the cohort and its data.

**2. Methodological exchanges:**
Facilitating the exchange of methods between the MRC Epidemiology Unit and the Epidemiology group at Aarhus University, with guidance in causal inference (including Mendelian randomization and mediation analysis) and machine learning techniques.

**3. Validation Expertise:** Supporting the harmonization of data between the Fenland Study, ADDITION-PRO, and UK Biobank to validate identified metabolic profiles and mediating pathways, such as liver health and inflammation, across diverse geographical and demographic contexts.

The synergy with the MRC Epidemiology Unit will be an ongoing institutional bridge with visit from PI, post doctoral stay and PhD visits. Our research is strategically aligned with the Unit’s mission to improve population health through better risk stratification. We will maintain regular scientific exchange through joint virtual meetings to align the analytically protocols used in the Fenland Study. This collaboration serves as a pilot for long-term data integration between Danish and UK cohorts, establishing a permanent channel for investigating the heterogeneity of type 2 diabetes and refining precision prevention strategies across borders.

![**Figure 3: Gantt chart**](figures/gant_diagram.pdf){width="8in"}

## Significance of the project

The Inter-SUSTAIN project aims to advance precision diabetes prevention by identifying easily obtainable biomarkers that accurately distinguish individuals with stable prediabetes, successful remission, or those at greatest risk of progression to diabetes. This work directly supports the objectives of the Novo Nordisk Foundation-funded Steno National grant,[DP-Next](https://dp-next.github.io), specifically [Work Package 3 (Heterogeneity)](https://dp-next.github.io/wp3.html), which seeks to develop strategies for diabetes prevention through predictive and potentially modifiable metabolic traits [@witte2025].

Leveraging the Fenland Study’s long-term, population-based follow-up data provides a unique opportunity to identify clinical and biological traits that characterize high-risk individuals and link these traits to longitudinal changes in cardiometabolic. This approach enables early identification of individuals with accelerated progression toward complications, supporting timely interventions such as intensive lifestyle modification or targeted pharmacological treatment.

Our work will deepen understanding of heterogeneity in type 2 diabetes risk and deliver clinical and genetic tools that can be applied across cohorts and registries to investigate population differences in intervention response. Ultimately, this project will contribute to precision prevention, enabling tailored decision-making that improves outcomes and reduces the global burden of cardiometabolic disease.
